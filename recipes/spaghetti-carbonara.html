            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This classic <strong>spaghetti alla carbonara</strong> recipe is smooth, creamy, and full of rich Italian flavor. <strong>Carbonara</strong> is a Roman dish made with eggs, hard cheese, and cured pork. Its signature rich and silky sauce comes from beaten eggs tossed with hot pasta.</p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Spaghetti</strong> 0.7 lb</li>
                <li><strong>Guanciale</strong> 5 oz</li>
                <li><strong>Egg yolks</strong> 6 ct</li>
                <li><strong>Pecorino Romano cheese</strong> 1/2 cup</li>
                <li><strong>Black pepper</strong> to taste</li>
              </ul>
            <h2>Preparation</h2>
            <p>To prepare <strong>spaghetti carbonara</strong> start by putting a pot of salted water on the burner to cook the pasta. In the meantime,</p> 
            <ol>
              <li>Remove the pork rind from the <em>guanciale</em></li>
              <li>Cut it first into slices and then into strips about 1/2" (1cm) thick. The removed rind can be reused to flavor other things</li>
              <li>Put the pieces into a non-stick pan and brown for about 15 minutes over medium heat, being careful not to burn it or it will smell too strong</li>
              <li>Meanwhile, put spaghetti in boiling water and cook for the time indicated on the package</li>
              <li>In the meantime, pour the yolks into a bowl</li>
              <li>and add most of the <em>Pecorino cheese</em> needed for the recipe. The remaining part will be used just before serving</li>
              <li>Season with black pepper and whip by hand</li>
              <li>Add a tablespoon of cooking water to dilute the mixture and stir</li>
              <li>In the meantime the <em>guanciale</em> will be cooked, turn off the burner and set it aside</li>
              <li>Drain the pasta al dente directly into the pan with the <em>guanciale</em> and stir it briefly to season it</li>
              <li>Remove from heat and pour the mixture of eggs and <em>pecorino cheese</em> into the pan. Mix quickly to combine</li>
              <li>To make it very creamy, if necessary, you can add a little cooking water to your pasta</li>
              <li>Serve <em>spaghetti carbonara</em> immediately with the remaining <em>pecorino cheese</em> and ground black pepper on top.</li>
            </ol>

      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p><strong>Pasta amatriciana</strong> is a traditional Italian dish that features a sauce of <em>guanciale</em> (salt-cured pork jowl), tomato, <em>pecorino romano</em> and chiles. Some variations include onion and white wine. The final product tastes much more complex than the ingredient list would suggest: This simple pantry meal delivers deep flavors, as the bright, tangy tomato base balances the rich pork, and a mix of dried peppers adds layers of subtle heat.</p>
      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Spaghetti</strong> 0.7 lb</li>
            <li><strong>Guanciale</strong> 5 oz</li>
            <li><strong>Peeled tomatoes</strong> 0.9 lb</li>
            <li><strong>Pecorino Romano cheese</strong> 3/4 cup</li>
            <li><strong>Extra virgin olive oil</strong> to taste</li>
            <li><strong>Fine salt</strong> to taste</li>
            <li><strong>Fresh chili pepper</strong> 1</li>
            <li><strong>White wine</strong> 1/4 cup</li>
        </ul>
      <h2>Preparation</h2>
      <p>To prepare <strong>Spaghetti Amatriciana</strong>, first boil the water to cook the pasta in, then add salt. Then, let's prepare the sauce:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Take the <em>guanciale</em> and remove the pork rind</li>
            <li>Cut it into slices about 1/4-inch (1 cm) thick</li>
            <li>then into strips about 1/8-inch (1/2 cm) wide</li>
            <li>Heat a drizzle of oil in a pan, preferably a stainless steel skillet, add the whole chili pepper and the guanciale cut into strips</li>
            <li>Brown over low heat for 7-8 minutes until the fat has melted and the meat is crunchy; stir often to prevent it from burning</li>
            <li>Once the fat has melted, pour in the white wine, turn up the heat and let it evaporate</li>
            <li>Transfer the <em>guanciale</em> to a plate and set aside</li>
            <li>Pour the peeled tomatoes into the same pan, breaking them up with your hands directly into the cooking liquid and continue cooking the sauce for about 10 minutes</li>
            <li>As soon as the water boils, pour in the spaghetti and cook them al dente</li>
            <li>Add salt to taste, remove the chili pepper from the sauce, add the guanciale strips to the pan and stir to mix</li>
            <li>Once the spaghetti are cooked, drain them and add them directly to the sauce in the pan</li>
            <li>Saut√© the pasta very quickly to mix it well with the sauce and sprinkle with grated <em>pecorino cheese</em></li>
        </ol>
      <p style="font-size: 24px;">Your <strong>Spaghetti all'Amatriciana</strong> is ready to be served!</p>
